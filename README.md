# rvsource

rvsource is a collection of links to various resources related to full-time RVing, specifically in an Airstream. I've been collecting these links as research for my own future plans, so I figured, why not turn them into a resource anyone could use? So that's what I did.

The site is built using React, React Router, Express, sequelize, and a PostgreSQL database to store the link information.
